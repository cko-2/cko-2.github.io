Requirements not met/not functional:
	all requirements met
	code is functional and has been tested extensively

Additional features/extra credit:
	no extra credit attempted
	additional debug info included

Future enhancements and/or general comments:
	currently, the only problem that exists is when a user types
	the address null-terminator(%) and keeps on typing on the same line
	this does not break the program in any way, but it reprints the menu
	because it sees the text after the null-terminator as new input
	this can be fixed in the future, but it is a rare case that does not hinder
	functionality

	as for general comments, i had a difficult time trying to read c++
	documentation and got stuck on the part where i needed to use stream objects
	to take a line from my record.txt and convert it to an int

	i feel like if i knew c++ more, i could improve the readability of the code,
	as well as decrease memory usage. for the most part, i was using project1 as
	a pseudo-pseudocode and writing code based off of that
