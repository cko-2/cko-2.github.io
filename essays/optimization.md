## Life on a streak 

Have you ever used Snapchat or Duolingo? These apps utilize 'Streaks' to influence behavior, compelling users to complete simple actions that may seem meaningless at times. By using behavioral psychology, specifically loss aversion, these apps create an environment where the main reason why we continue is to preserve the streak. While sending pictures of your ceiling to your friends every morning has no real value, it becomes as consistent as a personal hygiene routine. The fact that an app can compel you to build meaningless habits means that it can compel you to build meaningful ones as well; I believe that software created for this purpose can enhance lives dramatically if used correctly.

## How does software engineering help our everyday lives?

Realistically, there is no app that fits a person perfectly. If I want to use software to enhance someone's life, it would need to be fine-tuned and adjusted to fit specific needs, which will never be static. People's lives are always changing, our uniqueness as humans makes each of us individual edge cases. While software engineering can create apps that appeal to a general audience and have a positive impact on many lives, they will never be optimal for every person's needs. I believe that the only person who can truly optimize life through software is the developer themself. My goal in learning about software development is to create specific, fine-tuned applications that make my life substantially easier. By enhancing and optimizing my own life, I no longer need to allocate my energy towards trivial activities and can focus on what really matters.

## Time to optimize

Optimizations can be made everywhere in life; sometimes it becomes hard to notice when we've performed the same mundane tasks every day ritualistically without thinking of the alternatives. Having access to software engineering knowledge can be a powerful tool in enhancing daily tasks. For example, let's say I started a skincare routine: cleanse, exfoliate on these days, moisturize- wait, was I supposed to exfoliate today or tomorrow? The outcome is apparent: you either risk over-exfoliation or have an unoptimized routine. Sure, you can use a calendar app, or even a skincare reminder app, which may be made purely for this purpose, but these can be refined further when knowing your specific needs and preferences. By creating something that is tailored to your habits and routine, we can save seconds each day; do this multiple times, and we can save minutes each day. Over the years, this can lead to hundreds of hours saved, which not only optimizes our lives, but almost effectively extends it as well.
