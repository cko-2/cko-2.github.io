## Life on a streak

Have you ever used Snapchat or Duolingo? These apps utilize 'Streaks' in order to influence behavior, compelling users to complete simple actions that may seem meaningless at times. By using behavioral psychology, specifically loss aversion, these apps create an environment where the only reason why we continue is to preserve the streak. While sending pictures of your ceiling to your friends every morning has no real value, it becomes as consistent as a personal hygiene routine. The fact that an app can compel you to build meaningless habits means that it can compel you to build meaningful ones as well; I believe that software created for this purpose can enhance lives dramatically if used correctly.

## How does software engineering help our everyday lives?

Realistically, there is no app that fits a person perfectly. If I want to use software to enhance someone's life, it would need to be fine-tuned and adjusted to fit specific needs, which will never be static. People's lives are always changing, our uniqueness as humans makes us all individual edge-cases. While software engineering can create apps that appeal to a general audience and have a positive impact on many lives, they will never be optimal for every person's needs. I believe that the only person who can truly optimize life through software is the developer themself. My goal in learning about software development is to create specific, fine-tuned applications that make my life substantially easier. By enhancing and optimizing my own life, I no longer need to allocate my energy towards trivial activities and can focus on what really matters.
